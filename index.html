          I wont to find answer for this question. some statistics:
        </h3>
        <ol class="statistics__list">
          <li>
            A study commissioned by Britain's National Health Service (NHS)
            showed how much children's mental health has worsened since 2017. At
            that time, mental disorders were observed in one out of nine
            children. By July 2020, after the first quarantine, such disorders
            were identified in one child out of six. Among boys, the percentage
            of children with the disorder increased from 11% in 2017 to 16% in
            2020, and among girls from 10% to 15%.
          </li>
          <li>
            Divorce Statistics: Research shows that divorce can be one of the
            causes of unhappiness in adults. For example, according to
            statistics from the National Institutes of Health, about 40-50% of
            families in the United States get divorced, and divorce is often
            accompanied by stress and sometimes a long period of depression in
            the parents.
          </li>
          <li>
            Job Satisfaction Statistics: Job satisfaction studies show that a
            significant proportion of adults do not feel satisfied with their
            jobs. For example, Gallup's 2017 Global Job Satisfaction Survey
            found that only 15% of workers worldwide feel completely satisfied
            with their jobs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stress Statistics: High stress levels can be one of the causes of
            unhappiness in adults. For example, the American Psychological
            Association's 2019 Study on Stress in America found that money,
            work, and health are the top sources of stress for adults.
          </li>
          <li>
            Loneliness Statistics: Loneliness can also be a factor in
            unhappiness. A 2018 Cigna Health study on loneliness and happiness
            in the United States found that more than half of Americans feel
            lonely, and 20% said they rarely or never feel like they have
            someone who listens to them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Financial Insecurity Statistics: Lack of financial stability can
            also lead to unhappiness in adults. For example, a study examined
            the link between financial instability and mental health in adults
            and found that people with low incomes were more likely to
            experience depression and anxiety.
