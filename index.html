          I wont to find answer for this question. some statistics:
        </h3>
        <ol class="block__list">
          <li>
            A study commissioned by Britain's National Health Service (NHS)
            showed how much children's mental health has worsened since 2017. At
            that time, mental disorders were observed in one out of nine
            children. By July 2020, after the first quarantine, such disorders
            were identified in one child out of six. Among boys, the percentage
            of children with the disorder increased from 11% in 2017 to 16% in
            2020, and among girls from 10% to 15%.
          </li>
          <li>
            Divorce Statistics: Research shows that divorce can be one of the
            causes of unhappiness in adults. For example, according to
            statistics from the National Institutes of Health, about 40-50% of
            families in the United States get divorced, and divorce is often
            accompanied by stress and sometimes a long period of depression in
            the parents.
          </li>
          <li>
            Job Satisfaction Statistics: Job satisfaction studies show that a
            significant proportion of adults do not feel satisfied with their
            jobs. For example, Gallup's 2017 Global Job Satisfaction Survey
            found that only 15% of workers worldwide feel completely satisfied
            with their jobs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stress Statistics: High stress levels can be one of the causes of
            unhappiness in adults. For example, the American Psychological
            Association's 2019 Study on Stress in America found that money,
            work, and health are the top sources of stress for adults.
          </li>
          <li>
            Loneliness Statistics: Loneliness can also be a factor in
            unhappiness. A 2018 Cigna Health study on loneliness and happiness
            in the United States found that more than half of Americans feel
            lonely, and 20% said they rarely or never feel like they have
            someone who listens to them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Financial Insecurity Statistics: Lack of financial stability can
            also lead to unhappiness in adults. For example, a study examined
            the link between financial instability and mental health in adults
            and found that people with low incomes were more likely to
            experience depression and anxiety.

        <p class="text-item">
          Philosophically, people are unhappy because institutions have fallen.
          The institutions of marriage, the institution of the state, the
          institution of religion. In ancient times, people lived for 30 years
          and all they thought about was: how to feed their family, how to
          shelter from bad weather and how not to die from terrible diseases.
          Now we have covered all the basic needs and a new question arises:
          “What to do next?” What should a modern person do to understand what
          happiness is?
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-title">What is happiness?</h2>
        <p class="text-item">Albert Camus once said:</p>
        <p class="text-item-i">
          “People think that happiness is a reward for an honest life, and
          misfortune is a manifestation of the law. But both of these feelings
          are just shadows that illuminate our existence.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-item">
          In this quote, Camus states that happiness and unhappiness are
          countable parts of human experience.
        </p>
        <p class="text-item">
          Different directions of philosophy and religion solve this issue in
          different ways. Each person answers this question differently. My
          opinion is that this is a state, a state in which you face
          difficulties, with joy, but still remain yourself. There can be no
          endless joy, just like there can be no endless pleasure. In such a
          state, a person will very soon get bored. After all, in order to
          understand what good is, you need evil.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-title">Childhood</h2>
        <p class="text-item">
          Fred Rogers, who is known for his contributions to the field of child
          development and psychology:
        </p>
        <p class="text-item-i">
          "Children often know what they need to be happy. They just want to be
          accepted and loved for who they are."
        </p>
        <p class="text-item">
          This quote highlights the importance of accepting children for who
          they are and giving them love and support.
        </p>
        <p class="text-item">
          It seems to me that children do not have happiness; rather, they do
          not understand what it is. Children differ from adults in that they
          are not afraid to show their feelings. They have no embarrassment,
          fear of being misunderstood, or prejudices. They're just whatever I
          feel. They show it.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-title">What reasons make us unhappy?</h2>
        <p class="text-item">
          It is impossible to describe all the reasons; everyone has their own
          and affects it to a greater or lesser extent. You can highlight the
          most important and popular ones.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-title">Social media</h2>
        <p class="text-item-i">
          "Social media doesn't make us lonely. It makes us lonely together."
        </p>
        <p class="text-item">
          This quote draws attention to how social media can create the illusion
          of social connectedness but actually deepen feelings of loneliness and
          alienation. Virtual communication may not always replace real, deeper
          interactions, which can negatively impact our sense of happiness and
          well-being.
        </p>
        <p class="text-item">
          I think this is the main problem. They gave us the opportunity to talk
          to people on the other side of the world and keep in touch. But they
          also made it possible not to talk to those who were nearby. Any
          electronic dialogue has no magic. It is impossible to convey your
          sincere feelings without intonation.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-title">2. Historical events and doomscrolling</h2>
        <p class="text-item">
          Now is the most unstable time since the Second World War. There are
          currently 46 military conflicts going on simultaneously. Quarantine,
          economic crisis, fear of the future and scientific progress, the
          development of AI and the existential questions it raises. During such
          a period, people constantly refresh their news feed and mindlessly
          consume news, which leads to stress, anxiety and depression.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-title">3. Difficulty expressing emotions</h2>
        <p class="text-item">Kathy Griffin once said:</p>
        <p class="text-item-i">
          "The difficulty is that expressing your emotions clearly is like
          trying to explain color to a blind person."
        </p>

        <p class="text-item">
          In modern society, it is difficult to show your emotions because of
          the judgment of others, in some situations even of loved ones. Since
          childhood, we have been told: “Don’t cry! Do not scream! Be calm!” an
          emotional guy is perceived as weak. As a result, all people keep it
          inside themselves and it turns into hatred, anger, depression.
